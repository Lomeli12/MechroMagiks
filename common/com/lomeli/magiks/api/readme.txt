MechroMagik API version 0.0.5
=============================

This api is for a mod that is still in heavy 
development. That means that this api is either
lacking in features, messy, undocumented, 
or just completely broken. This is more is 
less used to test out what the mod can do at 
the moment and to possibly gain new ideas for 
the mod by things other people create (what's
better than user input?).

How to use
==========

Simply drag the "com" folder into which ever
directory you have your source for your addon

There should some comments ATM that should help.
